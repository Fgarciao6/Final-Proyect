# Hotel Data Analysis


This project is a part of Ironhack Data Analytics Part Time Bootcamp Course.

1.Project Description

The data hotel provide information about two type of hotels:

. City hotels

. Resort hotels

Also provide information about status of bookings:

. Confirmed

. Canceled

With these information we can predict when a booking is going to be cancel or not and in wich type of hotel.

2.Tools used

The main technologies used here are Python,Tableau Public and SQL. The raw data file has been imported and wrangled in Jupyter Lab notebook using Pandas, clean .csv files exported & imported in SQL.

The Jupyter notebook includes the statistical hypothesis test based on the p-value of a one-sided test for a relation between average ADR in city hotels and average ADR in Resort hotels.

3.Challenges identified

There have been two major challenges:

. It was clear how can I managed confirmed bookings but in the beginning i was not sure what can i do with canceled bookings. But finally working in a model and checking the correlation between if a booking is canceled or not it was possible to create a model to predict it.

. How apply inferential statistics and wich variables use but thinking about two difrerents types of hotel it was clear that I should check a Ttest and finally the null hypothesis was rejected.

4. How to use & install
